## My Approach

When solving LeetCode problems, I follow these principles:

1. **Understand the problem thoroughly** before writing any code
2. **Consider multiple approaches** and analyze their tradeoffs
3. **Optimize for readability and maintainability** while meeting performance requirements
4. **Document complexity analysis** to demonstrate understanding of algorithmic efficiency

## Language-specific Implementations

Solutions are organized by language:

- `/python/` - Python solutions utilizing idiomatic Python features and libraries
- `/c#/` - C# solutions demonstrating object-oriented design principles

## Future Improvements

- Add unit tests for each solution
- Include more detailed walkthroughs for complex problems
- Expand solutions to cover more programming languages
