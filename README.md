# LeetCode Solutions

My personal repo of annotated LeetCode solutions.
Most have some comments about the general approach of the algo and its space/time complexity.
Some have more than one solution per problem.

## Repository Structure

Solutions are organized by language:

- `/python/` - Python solutions
- `/c#/` - C# solutions

Each solution file is named with the LeetCode problem number and title, e.g. `207-Course-Schedule.py`

## Solution Format

Each solution file contains:

- Problem approach explanation in comments
- Time and space complexity analysis
- One or more solution implementations
- Test cases and example usage where applicable
